### simple-html-css-js

In my time as an instructor with [codingKIDZ](https://www.codingkidz.com/), I created a set of simple HTML5 games that would serve as a semester-long introduction to web development to students of all ages. This course was designed after seeing how receptive my students were to code-on-the-left, product-on-the-right learning while making a simple game as compared to an IDE with heavily modular code, dependencies, and scalability. 

Learning web development in local HTML files rather than online IDEs is advantageous for many reasons:

- **easy to understand** - the reload button in the web browser acts as a familiar "run" button
- **reproducible** - there are no functions that are pre-imported for the student by an IDE, meaning that any code that they write will behave (for the most part) identically offline and online, and across different computers and webpages
- **no account**- in a virtual learning context, there are often many usernames and passwords that go around, with some students using parents' computers and being logged into several Google accounts on the same browser. Local HTML development is just writing to a file and opening the file in a browser
- **dinosaur friendly** - many students get hand-me-down computers from older relatives, meaning that RAM-hungry online IDEs can hamper their learning experience and slow down development. Local HTML is very small (<5KB) and stored in a folder on the Desktop or in My Documents
